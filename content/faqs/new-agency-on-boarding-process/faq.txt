Question: How can a new agency be created on ECCO?

----

Answer: An on-boarding process usually takes place for a new agency. New users will be asked to create an account on ECCO, and existing users within the system will be assigned to the new agency. An ECCO Overview will take place once everyone is assigned to the new agency.
